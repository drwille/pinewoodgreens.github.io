													<h2>Travel and Commuting</h2>
													<p>
														The entrance to the Beltway is just 1 mile away – with the
														Route 66 interchange just a couple of miles beyond that.
														And we are about 100 feet from two Metrobus lines. But
														more important, we’re about 2 miles away from <a
															href="http://www.wmata.com">Metro</a> (both <a
															href="http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=102">Dunn
															Loring</a> and <a
															href="http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=101">West
															Falls Church</a>). You can walk there on snowy days. We are
														also only 1/2 mile from the <a
															href="http://www.nvrpa.org/park/w_od_railroad">Washington
															and Old Dominion (W&amp;OD)</a> bike trail.

													<h2>We're close to all kinds of things!</h2>
													<p>
														We’re just 15 miles away from the nation’s capital. We’re
														also just 5 miles from all the stores at <a
															href="http://www.shoptysons.com">Tysons Corner</a> mall,
														10 miles from the music under the stars at <a
															href="http://www.wolf-trap.org">Wolf Trap</a>, 15 miles
														away from the <a href="http://www.smithsonian.org">Smithsonian</a>,
														65 miles from the unbeatable views on Skyline Drive in <a
															href="http://www.nps.gov/shen">Shenandoah National
															Park</a> , and 265 miles from the wide beaches of the <a
															href="http://www.outerbanks.org">Outer Banks</a>.
													</p>
													<h2>Lots of improvement is coming to our area too!</h2>
													<p>
														Soon the <a href="http://www.mosaicdistrict.com/">Mosaic
															District</a> mixed-use development will be opening on the
														former site of the Merrifield Multiplex adding a Target
														and other retail nearby. A sidewalk is being built that
														will connect us directly to Merrifield. Also, the Capital
														Beltway <a href="http://www.virginiahotlanes.com/">HOT
															lanes</a> project will provide additional commuting options.

														And just in case you need it, here’s a <a

														our community. Use it if you need to e-mail directions to
														your home to your friends and guests.
