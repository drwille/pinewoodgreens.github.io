---

													<p>From May to September, home for many of us is a
														lounge chair by our pool. Some of us go to the pool for a
														few ZZZs in the sun. Others actually go to swim.</p>
													<p>The pool hours before Fairfax County schools close
														are:</p>
													<table>
														<tbody>
															<tr>
																<td>Tuesday - Friday</td>
																<td>4:30 pm – 8:00 pm</td>
															</tr>
															<tr>
																<td>Saturday and holidays</td>
																<td>11:00 am – 8:00 pm</td>
															</tr>
															<tr>
																<td>Sunday</td>
																<td>12:00 pm - 8:00 pm</td>
															</tr>
														</tbody>
													</table>
													<p>After school lets out, the hours change to:</p>
													<table>
														<tbody>
															<tr>
																<td>Tuesday - Friday</td>
																<td>2:00 pm – 8:00 pm</td>
															</tr>
															<tr>
																<td>Saturday and holidays</td>
																<td>11:00 am – 8:00 pm</td>
															</tr>
															<tr>
																<td>Sunday</td>
																<td>12:00 pm - 8:00 pm</td>
															</tr>
														</tbody>
													</table>

														needs a pool pass, from tots to grandparents. And everyone
														needs to apply, every year. We mail the application to you
														in April. A copy of the <a

															pass application</a> is also available on this website.

													<p>
														Each year we publish the <a
															href="https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=529E6218CA92DA58%211547">Pool
															Rules</a> for you and your family to read. Please take the
														time to read the rules before opening day to ensure that
														the pool is enjoyed by all.
													</p>
													<p>See you at the pool!</p>
