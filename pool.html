title: Making Waves – Summers at the Pool

<p>From May to September, home for many of us is a lounge chair by our pool. Some of us go to the pool for a few ZZZs in the sun. Others actually go to swim.</p>


<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">

<p>The pool hours before Fairfax County schools close are:</p>
<table class="table table-condensed">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Tuesday - Friday</td>
      <td>4:30 pm – 8:00 pm</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Saturday and holidays</td>
      <td>11:00 am – 8:00 pm</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sunday</td>
      <td>12:00 pm - 8:00 pm</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>After school lets out, the hours change to:</p>

Please remember that everyone needs a pool pass, from tots to grandparents. And everyone needs to apply, every year. We mail the application to you in April.

<p>Each year we publish the <a href="https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=529E6218CA92DA58%211547">Pool Rules</a> for you and your family to read. Please take the time to read the rules before opening day to ensure that the pool is enjoyed by all.</p>

<p>See you at the pool!</p>
