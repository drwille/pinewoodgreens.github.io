													<p>The day-to-day business of the association is
														handled at the Association office, located right in the
														middle of the community. The Association office is in the
														building next to the pool at 2731 Hyson Lane, Falls
														Church, Virginia 22043.</p>
													<p>We have two part-time employees working in the
														Association office, a financial manager and an association
														manager. One of the two is usually available during the
														office hours below.</p>

													<p>There may be times during these hours that the
														office is closed temporarily, to inspect the commons or to
														meet with homeowners. So it is always a good idea to call
														ahead if you need to talk with staff.</p>
													<p>If we miss you, leave us a note in the Association
														mailbox or give us a call at 703-560-8920 and leave us a
														message.</p>
