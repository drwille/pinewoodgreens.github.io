title: Trash and Recycling
---
													<p>Taking care of the community is a responsibility
														that we all share.</p>
													<h2>Put out Your Garbage on Tuesdays and Fridays</h2>
													<p>Trash should be on the curb by 6:00 a.m. on Tuesdays
														and Fridays. If that’s too early for the late sleepers on
														the house, we can put out the trash after 7:00 p.m. on
														Monday nights and Thursday nights. Use sturdy bags or
														garbage cans.</p>
													<h2>Read the Garbage Grid</h2>
													<p>
														The <a
															href="https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=529E6218CA92DA58%211550"
															target="_new">Garbage Grid</a> tells you what goes in the
														recycling bin, what to do with furniture and large
														appliances, how to dispose of yard trash, and other
														assorted guides for special item removal.
													</p>
													<p>
														<a href="http://www.aaatrash.com/">AAA Recycling &amp;
															Trash Removal Service</a> takes away our garbage. You can
														reach them at 703-818-8222.
													</p>
													<h2>Put out your Recycling on Fridays</h2>
													<p>Recycling day is Friday. The bins should be on the
														curb by 6:00 a.m. on Friday morning, or no earlier than
														7:00 p.m. on Thursday nights. Please don’t use your bin
														for regular household trash.</p>
													<h2>Getting a Replacement Recycling Bin</h2>
													<p>We always (well, almost always) have extras. Call
														the Association office. We'll be glad to give you one if
														you can stop by or we can leave one outside the
														Association office for you to pick up when you get home.</p>
