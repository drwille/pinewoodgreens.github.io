Taking care of the community is a responsibility that we all share.

## Put out Your Garbage on Tuesdays and Fridays

Trash should be on the curb by 6:00 a.m. on Tuesdays and Fridays. If that’s too early for the late sleepers on the house, we can put out the trash after 7:00 p.m. on Monday nights and Thursday nights. Use sturdy bags or garbage cans.

## Read the Garbage Grid

The [Garbage Grid](https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=529E6218CA92DA58%211550) tells you what goes in the recycling bin, what to do with furniture and large appliances, how to dispose of yard trash, and other assorted guides for special item removal.

[American Disposal](https://www.americandisposal.com/) takes away our garbage. You can reach them at 703-368-0500.

## Put out your Recycling on Fridays

Recycling day is Friday. The bins should be on the curb by 6:00 a.m. on Friday morning, or no earlier than 7:00 p.m. on Thursday nights. Please don’t use your bin for regular household trash.

## Getting a Replacement Recycling Bin

We always (well, almost always) have extras. If you would like a new recycling bin, please fill out this [online form](https://goo.gl/forms/hC3P9fvLzdyUwbZz1) and the office will provide one. You can also [call the Association office](contactus.html).
