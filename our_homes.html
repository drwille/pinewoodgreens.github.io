														everyone notices first about Pinewood Greens is the
														amazing amount of green space not found in most townhouse
														communities.
													</p>
													<p>Our commons are ample, with wide open spaces for
														Saturday afternoon football games and room to let the kids
														(and maybe the adults) to work off a little energy.</p>
													<p>Our 306 homes are two or three stories high, of
														brick and aluminum siding construction, painted in
														colonial colors reminiscent of Williamsburg. With three
														bedrooms and two full baths (sometimes more), one or more
														powder rooms, living rooms, dining rooms, and family
														rooms, our houses quickly become homes when the boxes are
														unpacked.</p>
													<p>The builder gave us three models to choose from:</p>
													<ul>
														<li><a
															href="sites/default/files/documents/floorplans/pinehurst.pdf">The
																Pinehurst</a></li>
														<li><a
															href="sites/default/files/documents/floorplans/oakmont.pdf">The
																Oakmont</a></li>
														<li><a
															href="sites/default/files/documents/floorplans/doral.pdf">The
																Doral</a></li>
													</ul>

														Each homeowner takes care of their home, as well as the
														fence and the front and back yard. Please remember that
														the <a
															href="sites/default/files/documents/legal/Declaration_of_Covenants.pdf">Covenants</a>
														(a part of the deed of your property under Virginia law)
														require you to maintain the exterior of your property, and
														also require you to submit an <a
															href="https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=529E6218CA92DA58%211560">Application
															for Architectural Review</a> if you want to make a change to
														the exterior of your home.
