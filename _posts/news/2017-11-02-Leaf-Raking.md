title: Leaf Pickup from the Commons (11/6 and 12/4)
---

Don't forget to rake your leaves out onto the commons by Monday morning (11/6) for pickup!
Leaves will be picked up by our lawn service for composting - they don't belong in the trash!

After this there will be one more chance on Monday 12/4.
