title: Parking in our Neighborhood
---

Over the past few weeks, we have received complaints and comments about problems with parking.  In particular, we have had an uptick in complaints regarding inoperable vehicles and vehicles that have been parked in the same unreserved parking spot for longer than authorized.

Parking (or the lack of spaces to park) is a problem in almost every townhouse community.  In our community we have approximately two parking spots per unit including reserved parking.

#### Reserved parking

Do not ever use another home’s reserved spot. Pinewood Greens parking regulations give each homeowner the right to tow any car parked in his/her reserved spot.  To have a vehicle towed from your reseved parking spot, please contact Pete's Towing & Storage at 703-533-1355.

#### Non-reserved Parking

Non-reserved parking spaces are on a first come, first serve basis. No homeowner has any specific rights to any non-reserved spot. If you have more than two cars: It has long been the courtesy practice within Pinewood Greens the third (or more) car from a given home NOT be parked on the court. These vehicles should be parked on Hyson Lane or in areas where extra spaces are consistently available at night and on weekends. This gives more chance for neighbors with only two cars to park on the court near their house.

#### Long term storage of vehicles

If you have a vehicle that is consistently not used, park it on Hyson Lane. We barely have enough spaces to go around. The lots on the courts cannot be used to store unused vehicles.
Under Pinewood Greens Common Property Parking Regulations, residents shall NOT park longer than 15 consecutive days in an unreserved space. If you do, you will be towed. 

#### Out of Date Registration

Pinewood Greens regulations prohibit vehicles with out of date license plates or windshield stickers from parking in our neighborhood. If your vehicle’s license or stickers are out of date, you will get a tow notice.

#### Non-functioning Vehicles

Vehicles that obviously cannot be driving are prohibited from parking on Pinewood Greens common property.
