title: Welcome Scott Greges, New On-Site Community Manager
---
Our on-site community manager for the last several years, Casey Kaplan, began another assignment with 
CAMP on October 1. We wish Casey the best with her new community and thank her for all that she has done 
for Pinewood Greens.

We're excited to welcome Scott Greges to Pinewood Greens!  He comes to us with a broad range of community 
management experience. He holds both the Certified Manager of Community Associations (CMCA) and the 
Association Management Specialist designations from the Community Associations Institute.

Scott worked with Casey and CAMP management during September to ensure that we have a seamless transition.
