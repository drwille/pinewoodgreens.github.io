title: We need you to vote “Yes” to continue services!
---

Around November 4, you should have received a large envelope from us. Here's a summary.

We’re changing our administrative approach to how we categorize quarterly assessments. Legally, we have to do this, and **we need membership (you) to approve it.**

There will be a meeting on December 13 to vote. 
**A "Yes" vote doesn't increase what you'll pay in 2018.** It will be the same as 2017. 
Without enough “Yes” votes, we won’t be able to provide basic services like trash pickup, lawn care, or pool. 
**Please vote “Yes” on both proxies now**, and email them to office@pinewoodgreens.com, even if you plan on attending December 13.
You can take a picture and email from your phone - no scanner needed!
