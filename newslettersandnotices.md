## Announcements

Pinewood Greens announcements are posted to our [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Pinewood-Greens-HOA/116639735027256?v=wall).

## Newsletter

The Association newsletter, The Bark, is published twice annually and distributed to all of the homes in the neighborhood. It is not yet online, but you can contact the office if you missed an issue. In addition, notices are sent out for particular announcements as needed.

## Bulletin Board

We also have a bulletin board on the front of the community center at 2731 Hyson Lane (the building beside the pool).
