														When you think about home, you're bound to think about
														wide open spaces with kids playing ball games on sunny
														afternoons, streets lined with trees that give shade in
														the summer, a rainbow of umbrellas around the pool, and
														quiet homes that provide refuge to kids and parents and
														friends. You have just imagined the picture of Pinewood
														Greens. <img alt="" longdesc="Front of house"

														web site will tell you more about our neighborhood. For
														folks who live here already it will serve as a reference
														and keep you current. We also hope that it will also serve
														as an introduction for those seeking a new home in our
														neighborhood. Use the menu to learn more about who we are
														and how our Association works. Thank you for dropping by.
														If you have any questions or just want to stop and talk,
														just drop by the Association office. We stand ready to
														help.
