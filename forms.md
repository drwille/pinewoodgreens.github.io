It is important for you to remember that you must submit an Application for Architectural Review before you make any changes to the outside of your property. Here are some forms for you to print out and submit electronically (email to office@pinewoodgreens.com) or drop off at the community center. Please note that when you submit the special application for replacement of roof or windows and are not making any other changes, you do **not** need to also the submit standard Application for Architectural Review.
