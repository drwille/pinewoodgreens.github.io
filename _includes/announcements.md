#### Fall Leaf Collection

With the leaves falling from the trees, don't forget to rake the leaves out of your front and back yards onto the commons behind your house for the landscaper to pick up.

Our landscaping contractor will be collecting leaves from the common areas on either Monday, November 7th or Tuesday November 8th.  The second leaf collection will happen during the first week of December.  We'll provide more updates when the final pickup date is finalized.
